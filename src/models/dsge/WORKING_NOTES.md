# DSGE Modeling: Post-GFC Challenges

Working notes on the fundamental mismatch between DSGE theory and post-GFC observations.

**Executive thesis**: Post-GFC DSGE models fail not because estimation is difficult, but because the economy ceased to be constrained by reproducible capital. Growth increasingly occurs through non-rival, intangible, and rent-bearing inputs, while saving is absorbed by asset valuations rather than investment. Monetary policy can still move prices and financial conditions, but r* no longer anchors growth or investment decisions. Post-GFC policy proved effective at stabilising macroeconomic levels but largely ineffective at altering the economy's growth rate or restoring the capital–investment–r* linkage.

By "reproducible capital" I mean finance-requiring capital formation that expands aggregate productive capacity (factories, equipment, infrastructure, R&D that scales with spending) - not rents embedded in scarce claims (market power, network effects, brand value, regulatory moats).

This paper synthesises insights from secular stagnation, intangible capital, macro–finance, and balance-sheet monetary economics into a unified explanation for post-GFC DSGE failure.

**The causal chain**: Production shifts toward non-rival, rent-bearing intangibles, making investment in reproducible, finance-requiring capital less elastic to interest rates and more constrained by rents and market structure - so the mapping from the policy rate to the marginal product of new capital weakens. Desired saving persists, so the goods-market clearing rate (r*) falls. The excess saving is absorbed through higher valuations and claims on rents rather than new capital formation. As wedges open between the policy rate and the rates relevant for private decisions, policy transmits mainly via spreads, wealth effects, and collateral values - not the representative-agent Euler-equation intertemporal margin. Structural estimation then pushes the NK IS and Taylor-rule parameters to their bounds. This is one mechanism, not many separate failures.

**What this argument is not**:
- Not "money is exogenous" or "base determines credit" - money is endogenous; the base-M3 divergence reveals dominant transmission channels
- Not "two literal SDFs in frictionless GE" - segmentation and institutional constraints produce persistent wedges
- Not "global QE shows up in Australian monetary aggregates pre-2020" - the pre-2020 transmission was via yields and asset prices, not quantities
- Not "policy is ineffective" - policy stabilised levels; it could not restore the capital–investment–r* linkage

## What We Built

A 4-equation New Keynesian DSGE model for Australia:

1. **IS Curve**: Output gap depends on expected future output and real interest rate
2. **Price Phillips Curve**: Inflation depends on expected future inflation and output gap
3. **Wage Phillips Curve**: Wage inflation similarly determined
4. **Taylor Rule with Smoothing**: Interest rate responds to inflation and output gap

Solved via Blanchard-Kahn method, estimated by maximum likelihood using Kalman filter.

## Estimation Results

With 4 observables (output gap, inflation, interest rate, wage inflation) from 1993Q1-2025Q3:

| Parameter | Estimate | Bound | Issue |
|-----------|----------|-------|-------|
| κ_p (Phillips slope) | 0.01 | Lower | Flat Phillips curve |
| φ_π (Taylor inflation) | 1.01 | Lower | Minimal inflation response |
| φ_y (Taylor output) | 2.00 | Upper | Maximum output response |
| ρ_i (rate smoothing) | 0.92 | Interior | Reasonable |

The optimizer wants the Taylor rule to be as flexible as possible - minimal systematic response to inflation, maximum response to output, high smoothing.

This is not a coding, filtering, or identification problem. The likelihood is telling us the model is wrong.

**Why these specific bounds?** If the IS slope is weak (transmission broken), the model can only fit output volatility by letting policy respond aggressively to output (φ_y → upper bound). Meanwhile, inflation isn't moving with slack in the 2010s, so κ_p → lower bound and φ_π → lower bound (no point responding to inflation that doesn't respond to gaps). High smoothing (ρ_i) helps match inertial rates and forward guidance regimes. The bounds are not arbitrary - they're the model's attempt to fit data generated by a different transmission mechanism.

## What the Model Still Gets Right

The NK-DSGE framework is not useless - it's incomplete for the post-GFC period. It still captures:

- **Pre-GFC dynamics**: When policy rates moved freely and transmitted through conventional channels
- **Inflation anchoring**: The role of credible monetary policy in stabilising expectations
- **Short-run responses outside the ZLB**: Conventional rate changes still affect output and inflation directionally
- **Qualitative transmission**: The signs and relative magnitudes of structural shocks

The failure is specific: the model breaks down when the policy rate diverges from the rate relevant for private decisions, and when asset market dynamics dominate goods market dynamics.

## The Phillips Curve in Perspective

The flat Phillips curve (κ_p hitting its lower bound) deserves separate attention, because the Australian data tell a more nuanced story.

| Period | Phillips Curve | Context |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| 1998-2002 | Steep | Pre-GFC, conventional policy |
| 2003-2008 | Steep | Pre-GFC boom |
| 2010-2019 | **Flat** | Post-GFC, QE era, low r* |
| 2021-2025 | Steep | Post-COVID inflation shock |

The Phillips curve failed **specifically in the 2010s** - exactly when r* collapsed, QE dominated, and the transmission mechanism shifted to asset prices. Before and after, the curve worked: a clear negative relationship between unemployment and inflation.

The 2021-2025 inflation episode was supply-driven at origin (COVID, energy) but leaked into demand via fat balance sheets and tight labor markets. Disinflation came from supply normalisation and financial tightening, with inflation and unemployment moving in a way broadly consistent with a Phillips-type relationship. Inflation can re-emerge through supply shocks and distributional channels even when the intertemporal investment margin priced by r* remains weak.

**Key implication**: The flat Phillips curve was regime-specific, not permanent. What remains unresolved is whether the IS-curve transmission and r* will similarly normalise, or whether the 2010s revealed a deeper structural shift that the inflation shock temporarily masked. The Phillips curve has woken up; r* has not re-anchored.

## The LW/HLW Response

Before diagnosing the deeper problem, it's worth noting how the profession responded initially.

Laubach-Williams (2003) and Holston-Laubach-Williams (2017) emerged because:

1. Standard Taylor rules with constant r* were failing
2. Needed to track time-varying natural rate
3. Semi-structural approach - doesn't impose full DSGE optimisation
4. Links r* to trend growth (when growth fell, r* fell)

This was a pragmatic response: acknowledge r* moves, estimate it as an unobserved state, sidestep full DSGE structure.

But even LW/HLW doesn't explain the deeper disconnect that emerged.

## The Taylor Rule Problem

Central observation: **"Since 2008, Taylor hasn't described central bank action at all."**

The standard Taylor rule assumes:
- Constant equilibrium real rate r*
- Systematic response to inflation deviations
- Policy rate equals the rate relevant for private decisions

Post-GFC reality:
- r* collapsed (near zero or negative)
- Forward guidance and QE replaced rate movements
- Zero lower bound constrained policy for extended periods
- Transmission mechanism shifted from interest rate channel to asset prices

This isn't claiming central banks were random - it's saying the mapping from instrument to private behaviour collapsed.

## The r* vs Market Returns Disconnect

This is the deeper puzzle that no unified general-equilibrium framework currently explains.

| Measure | Post-GFC Level |
|---------|----------------|
| Policy rates | Near zero |
| Estimated r* (LW/HLW) | Near zero or negative |
| Equity returns | ~7% real |
| Housing returns | Strong |
| Corporate bond spreads | Compressed |

If r* is the rate that equilibrates savings and investment, arbitrage should close the gap with market returns. It didn't.

### What r* Still Measures

This is not a claim that r* is meaningless - it's a claim about its domain. r* remains a meaningful anchor in economies where growth is predominantly capital-intensive, investment demand is elastic to interest rates, and returns to capital are competed down by entry. In such environments, r* equilibrates saving and investment and tracks trend growth.

What r* is *not*:

- The discount rate for monopoly rents
- The hurdle rate for intangible investment
- The return on market power or network effects
- The marginal return to innovation or scalable software

Post-GFC, marginal growth increasingly came from sources outside r*'s domain. The rate that clears the market for tangible capital can fall toward zero while returns to intangibles, rents, and market power stay elevated. These are not the same object, and arbitrage cannot close the gap because you cannot reproduce Apple's market power by investing at the risk-free rate.

**Operational implication**: r* remains useful for diagnosing cyclical slack and inflation pressure in goods markets, but is no longer a sufficient guide to neutral financial conditions or investment incentives.

Conceptually, the post-GFC economy is best understood as a two-market system: a goods market clearing at a low r*, and an asset market clearing via valuations and rents, with weak arbitrage between the two.

### The Goods-Rate vs Asset-Rate Wedge

The post-GFC period saw a persistent wedge between the discount rate relevant for goods-market intertemporal choice (r*) and the discount rate pricing risky rent claims. In asset-pricing terms, these are two distinct stochastic discount factors - not literally two SDFs in one frictionless GE, but segmentation and institutional constraints producing persistent divergence.

The split:

1. **Goods-market rate**: Low r*, persistent slack, muted inflation response to policy
2. **Asset-market rate**: High required returns, elevated valuations, compressed risk premia

Standard macro theory assumes these must equilibrate. They didn't - for over a decade.

**Why arbitrage didn't close the gap**: High asset returns reflect monopoly rents, scalability of intangible-heavy business models, and concentration risk - not the marginal productivity of aggregate reproducible capital. You cannot arbitrage away Apple's market power by building more factories at the risk-free rate.

### Implications

1. **Transmission mechanism shifted**: Low policy rates affected the economy through:
   - Wealth effects (asset price appreciation)
   - Financial conditions (credit availability)
   - NOT the traditional IS curve (consumption smoothing via interest rate)

2. **The DSGE IS curve is misspecified**:
   ```
   ŷ = E[ŷ'] - σ·(i - E[π])
   ```
   This assumes the policy rate is the rate relevant for private decisions. When firms price off WACC, equity hurdle rates, and cost of capital >> policy rate, the Euler equation loses empirical meaning. Households face credit spreads, not policy rates. Asset holders and non-holders respond differently.

## The Monetary Transmission Mechanism: QE and the Base-Credit Divergence

The "two pricing kernels" observation has a concrete empirical signature in Australian monetary data: the divergence between base money and broad money (M3).

**Australian context**: The RBA only began QE in March 2020 - a decade after the Fed, ECB, and BoJ. Yet Australia exhibited the same 2010s symptoms (flat Phillips curve, asset price inflation, weak business investment, compressed term premia) under conventional monetary policy. As a small open economy, Australia imported global QE effects through capital flows, wholesale funding markets, and asset price spillovers. The primary channel: offshore QE compressed global term premia and duration prices, pulling down ACGB yields and mortgage rates even without domestic unconventional policy. The base-M3 evidence below is specifically Australian post-2020 data, but the broader pattern reflects global transmission to an open economy that benefited from - and was shaped by - QE it did not conduct domestically. If this is correct, Australian long yields and term premia should co-move with global QE shocks even before domestic QE - a testable implication.

**Important distinction**: The pre-2020 "imported QE" claim is about *price* transmission (yields, term premia, asset valuations), not *quantity* transmission. You would not expect to see global QE in Australian monetary aggregates - the base is a domestic RBA liability, and M3 growth reflects domestic credit creation. The base-M3 divergence evidence presented below is specifically about post-2020 domestic QE. The 2010s transmission operated through yield compression and collateral values, which show up in asset prices and borrowing costs, not in money supply charts.

**Why Australia is a clean test case**: Housing dominance (household debt ~120% of GDP, mostly mortgages), bank balance sheets concentrated in property lending, tax settings favouring housing over productive investment, and immigration-driven demand interacting with constrained land supply. These features amplify the collateral-valuation channel and make Australia a particularly clear laboratory for the wedge between goods-market r* and asset-market pricing. Australia doesn't create the global regime; it makes the wedge visible.

### What the Data Show

| Measure | Pre-COVID | QE Peak (2022) | Post-QT (2025) |
|---------|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| Money base | ~$110B | ~$550B | ~$322B |
| M3 | ~$2.15T | ~$2.9T | ~$3.33T |

The patterns are strikingly different:

**Money base** (reserves + currency): Flat pre-COVID, exploded under QE, contracted sharply under QT. Still above pre-COVID trend but falling rapidly. This is pure central bank balance sheet policy.

**M3** (broad money / credit): Jumped at COVID, then kept rising on a steeper trajectory. Never mean-reverted to the pre-COVID trend. This is endogenous credit creation - bank deposits, mortgage lending, asset-backed money. In Australia, broad money growth largely reflects mortgage and asset-market credit creation rather than financing business capital deepening.

### The Diagnostic Fact

Base money and broad money are no longer tightly linked.

This tells us:
- Banks are not reserve-constrained
- Credit creation is collateral-constrained
- Money is endogenous, not controlled by the base

This is already inconsistent with the transmission mechanism embedded in NK-DSGE.

**A note of caution**: Base and broad money can diverge even in standard endogenous-money frameworks; the divergence alone is not decisive. The load-bearing inference is the *combination*: credit constrained by collateral and risk-capital (not reserves), aligning with asset-price-led transmission and weak capex response. M3 growth also reflects portfolio shifts (deposit reclassification, precautionary saving) alongside credit creation. The claim is not that "base doesn't matter," but that the identifying pattern - QT shrinking reserves while credit expands and capex stays weak - reveals a transmission mechanism inconsistent with standard NK-DSGE.

### Why This Matters for r*

In DSGE logic:
- r* equilibrates saving and investment
- The policy rate pins short rates
- QE should work by shifting term premia, nudging intertemporal substitution
- QT should reverse this

But the data show:
- QT destroyed reserves
- Yet broad credit continued to grow

That implies the binding constraint is not reserves but balance-sheet capacity (capital, risk, collateral) - and the policy rate transmits primarily through spreads and asset prices rather than a single Euler-equation intertemporal margin.

The term premia and portfolio composition affected by central bank balance-sheet policy are not the same as the real rate that clears credit and asset markets. This makes r* a weak anchor.

### What QE Actually Did

QE operated through three channels that DSGE does not model well:

**1. Safe asset substitution**

QE replaced government bonds with reserves on private balance sheets. Investors, reaching for yield, shifted toward housing, equities, and credit products - not toward productive capex.

**2. Collateral values, not investment demand**

Higher asset prices relaxed borrowing constraints and supported mortgage lending. M3 grew and asset prices rose, but business investment stayed weak. This is credit expansion without capital deepening.

**3. Permanent balance sheet regime change**

Once banks operate with abundant reserves, capital and risk become the binding constraints - not reserves. QT does not symmetrically reverse QE. Draining reserves tightens margins and raises spreads, but does not recreate capital scarcity.

The result: asymmetric dynamics where QE pushes asset prices up strongly, but QT tightens without restoring the old regime.

### Why r* Looks "Broken"

r* assumes one interest rate, one intertemporal margin, and long-run monetary neutrality.

The base-M3 divergence shows:
- Multiple margins
- Segmented balance sheets
- Money affects who holds what, not how much capital exists

So r* still exists as a goods-market equilibrium object, but no longer governs the dominant transmission channel. That's why r* stays low, asset returns stay high, IS curve coefficients collapse, and Taylor rules hit bounds.

### QT vs M3: The Key Insight

QT is tightening financial conditions without restoring the capital–growth–rate nexus.

- QT shrinks base money ✓
- QT raises rates ✓
- QT slows some activity ✓
- But M3 still grows
- And productive investment does not surge
- And r* does not re-anchor to growth

QE/QT affect the distribution and pricing of risk, not the underlying scarcity that r* is meant to price.

This is not a claim of permanent monetary non-neutrality, but a claim that monetary policy operates on asset allocation and risk pricing when capital scarcity is no longer binding.

### QE Revealed, Not Caused, the Regime Change

This evidence supports rather than replaces the production-structure hypothesis. QE made money creation more asset-centric, amplifying an economy already drifting toward intangible growth, rent extraction, housing dominance, and weak capital deepening.

QE didn't create the disease - it removed the remaining constraints that hid it.

> The post-GFC divergence between the monetary base and broad money shows that monetary policy now operates through balance sheet and asset-price channels, not through the capital-scarcity channel that r* prices - rendering r* a weak guide to macro dynamics.

## What Theory Is Missing

We have fragments, not a coherent framework:

| Phenomenon | Observation | Theoretical Gap |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Reach for yield | Investors accepted compressed spreads | Standard expected-utility models cannot rationalise this without implausible beliefs or constraints |
| QE effects | Asset prices up, goods prices flat | Should move together in standard models |
| Buybacks > investment | Corporations returned capital | Should invest if returns > cost of capital |
| Persistent low rates | Didn't stimulate investment | IS curve says they should |
| Secular stagnation | Describes symptoms | Mechanism unclear |
| Large fiscal deficits | Supported demand, not capital deepening | Should crowd in or crowd out investment |

**Fiscal–monetary asymmetry**: This framework implies that monetary policy primarily reallocates risk and valuations, while only fiscal policy can directly expand tangible capital demand (through public investment or targeted incentives). This helps explain why large post-GFC expansions - both monetary and fiscal - stabilised demand without restoring capital deepening: monetary policy moved asset prices; fiscal policy supported incomes; neither altered the production structure.

### DSGE Assumptions That Broke Down

1. **Representative agent**: No heterogeneity between asset holders and non-holders
2. **One interest rate**: No wedge between policy rate and market returns
3. **Rational arbitrage**: No persistent mispricings or "reach for yield"
4. **Investment = savings**: At equilibrium rate - which didn't hold

## A Speculative Hypothesis: The Production Structure Shifted

The observations above are usually explained as market failures, financial frictions, or cyclical headwinds. But there may be a deeper structural explanation.

**Hypothesis**: Economic growth decoupled from capital accumulation. If true, r* is no longer tied to GDP growth in any fundamental sense.

The core claim is that modern growth is increasingly generated by non-rival, intangible, and rent-bearing inputs, breaking the historical link between output growth and capital scarcity that r* prices.

### The Classical Chain (Pre-GFC)

Standard macro theory assumes:

1. Growth comes from capital deepening plus labour
2. Capital is scarce and rival
3. Investment demand rises with growth
4. r* equilibrates saving and investment
5. Therefore r* ≈ trend growth rate

This logic is embedded in Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans, Solow, and standard DSGE models. The Euler equation assumes households smooth consumption against a rate that prices intertemporal capital scarcity.

### Balance-Sheet Absorption

A heuristic disciplines the narrative: when desired saving exceeds tangible investment opportunities, the excess is absorbed through higher prices of existing assets (valuation gains) and claims on rents (equity in intangible-heavy firms), rather than new capital formation.

In the classical world, saving flowed predominantly to tangible investment, and r* cleared that market. When tangible investment demand is saturated - because marginal growth no longer requires marginal capital - saving must be absorbed elsewhere. The residual shows up as asset price appreciation and claims on monopoly rents.

This is why low r* and high asset returns are not contradictory: they reflect the same underlying shift. r* falls because tangible capital is abundant; asset returns stay high because saving chases the scarce thing (rents, market power, scalability) rather than the abundant thing (reproducible capital).

### What May Have Changed

Post-2000s growth increasingly came from:

- Software and algorithms
- Data and platforms
- Network effects
- Brand and organisational capital
- Winner-take-most market structures

These have radically different properties from physical capital:

| Property | Physical Capital | Intangible Capital |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Rival? | Yes | Often no |
| Requires external finance? | Yes | Often internal cash flow |
| Scales with investment? | Linearly | Super-linearly (or not at all) |
| Appears in measured investment? | Yes | Poorly |
| Returns accrue to | Marginal product | Rents, market power |

This is not a claim that intangibles dominate all production, but that *marginal* growth increasingly does not require marginal tangible capital. This doesn't deny other headwinds to capex (policy uncertainty, competitive dynamics, regulation); the claim is that even removing them, the marginal growth engine appears less capital-absorbing than in earlier decades.

If this characterisation is roughly correct, several implications follow:

### Implication 1: The Investment-Growth Link Broke

You can grow output without accumulating much measured capital. A software platform scales globally with minimal marginal investment. A network effect creates value through adoption, not capital expenditure.

This would break the classical chain at the root: higher growth no longer implies higher investment demand, so r* need not rise with g.

### Implication 2: MPK for Tangible Capital Stagnated

In standard theory: higher growth → higher marginal product of capital → higher r*.

But if growth accrues to intangibles and rents rather than reproducible capital, the marginal product of *measured* tangible capital can stagnate even as GDP grows.

### Implication 3: Saving Has Nowhere Productive to Go

The economy still generates saving, but growth no longer creates enough tangible investment demand to absorb it.

The equilibrium real rate must fall until:
- The marginal saver is indifferent
- Marginal low-productivity projects get funded
- Or saving is absorbed by asset price inflation

This would explain r* collapsing without implying the economy is stagnating.

### Implication 4: Asset Returns Reflect Rents, Not Capital Scarcity

This may resolve the "two pricing kernels" puzzle. Equity returns reflect:

- Monopoly rents from market power
- Scalability of intangible-heavy business models
- Option value and concentration risk

These are not returns to aggregate capital scarcity. They're returns to *specific* assets that captured the intangible-driven growth.

So r* (goods-market rate) can fall while asset returns stay elevated. No arbitrage closes this gap because:

- Rents are not reproducible capital
- Markets are segmented (you can't arbitrage Apple's market power)
- High returns compensate for concentration risk, not intertemporal substitution

### Why the GFC May Have Been a Trigger, Not a Cause

On this view, the GFC:

- Forced deleveraging that revealed overcapacity in tangible investment
- Accelerated digital substitution (already underway)
- Legitimised ultra-low safe rates
- Exposed and locked in an underlying structural shift

The shift was already happening; the crisis made it visible.

### Caveats and Limitations

This remains speculative. Several objections apply:

1. **Measurement**: Intangible investment is increasingly captured in national accounts (R&D capitalisation since SNA 2008). The "missing capital" story may be overstated.

2. **Timing**: The shift should have been gradual, but r* fell abruptly post-GFC. This could reflect threshold effects, or the GFC may have been more causal than this hypothesis allows.

3. **Cross-country variation**: If this is a technology-driven shift, it should affect all advanced economies similarly. It largely has - but idiosyncratic factors (demographics, policy) also matter.

4. **Unfalsifiable?**: Without a formal model, this risks being a just-so story. The hypothesis needs to generate testable predictions beyond "r* fell." One candidate: industries with high intangible intensity should show high returns, low capex, and weak sensitivity to interest rates. If intangible-heavy sectors respond to rate changes as strongly as tangible-heavy sectors, the hypothesis is in trouble.

5. **Alternative explanations**: Demographics (ageing → more saving), inequality (rich save more), safe asset shortage, and secular stagnation all offer competing or complementary accounts.

### Why This Still Has No Unified Theory

Formalising this hypothesis would require:

- Endogenous market power
- Non-rival capital in production
- Segmented asset markets
- Heterogeneous agents with portfolio choice
- Financial dominance over goods markets

No closed-form general equilibrium model does all of this tractably. So we keep getting "what happened" decompositions without a unified "why."

### Connection to DSGE Failures

If this hypothesis has merit, the DSGE failures documented above are not primarily about:

- Financial frictions (though those matter)
- Zero lower bound (though that constrained policy)
- Expectations formation (though that's hard to model)

They're about the **production function**. Standard DSGE assumes:

```
Y = F(K, L, A)  where K is rival, depreciates, requires finance
```

But if reality is closer to:

```
Y = F(K_tangible, K_intangible, L, A)
where K_intangible is non-rival, self-financing, and scales without investment
```

...then the Euler equation's interest rate is pricing the wrong thing. The rate that clears tangible capital markets has limited relevance for aggregate growth dynamics.

This would explain why the IS curve coefficient hits bounds, why Taylor rules stopped describing policy, and why "reach for yield" is rational when productive tangible investment is saturated.

### AI and the App Economy: The Hypothesis Intensified

AI may be the limiting case of intangible-driven growth - and a natural test of the hypothesis.

**The pattern**:

| Traditional production | AI/App economy |
|-----------------------|----------------|
| Factory, equipment, inventory | Laptop, cloud credits, API calls |
| Scales with capital investment | Scales with users and data |
| Marginal cost > 0 | Marginal cost ≈ 0 |
| Returns to reproducible capital | Returns to network effects, brand, model weights |
| Finance-constrained | Talent-constrained |

A foundation model costs $100M+ to train, but once trained it's non-rival - it serves billions simultaneously at near-zero marginal cost. The "capital" is the model weights, the data, the network effect. None of this requires ongoing finance at the margin.

**Capital-intensive at the frontier, capital-free downstream**: Nvidia and hyperscalers absorb the capex. The rest of the economy accesses AI via API. Productivity may rise across the economy without corresponding investment demand.

**This fits the falsification test**: The hypothesis predicts that intangible-intensive industries should show high returns, low capex, and weak sensitivity to interest rates. The 2022-2024 period offers a natural experiment:

- Rates rose from near-zero to 5%+
- AI investment and adoption *accelerated*
- Nvidia's returns were extraordinary
- Downstream AI adopters needed no capital expenditure

If the traditional transmission mechanism worked, rate hikes should have slowed investment. Instead, the most intangible-intensive sector boomed. This is consistent with the hypothesis - though one episode is not definitive.

**What would an AI bubble/bust mean?**

If AI valuations collapse, it tests the hypothesis in an interesting way:

1. **If the hypothesis is correct**: A bust would destroy rents and equity valuations, but r* would stay low. The underlying dynamic - growth doesn't require broad capital investment - would persist. Asset prices would crash while the safe rate remained depressed. This would mirror the 2000 dot-com bust: equity carnage, but no restoration of the capital-growth link.

2. **What would falsify the hypothesis**: If an AI bust led to r* *rising* - because "real" capital-intensive growth resumed and absorbed saving - that would suggest the intangibles story was overstated. The bust would have revealed that the divergence was cyclical froth, not structural shift.

3. **The dot-com parallel**: After 2000, equity values collapsed but r* continued falling. Growth eventually resumed through the surviving platforms (Google, Amazon). The bust reallocated rents among firms; it didn't restore the link between growth and capital scarcity. If AI follows this pattern, the hypothesis survives. If it doesn't, the hypothesis needs revision.

4. **A more nuanced outcome**: AI may require sustained massive investment at the frontier (chips, data centers, power generation) while remaining capital-free downstream. A bust could reveal that frontier AI is more capital-intensive than software - but the downstream economy, which uses AI without investing, might still decouple from r*. The hypothesis might hold for most of the economy while failing for the AI hyperscalers themselves.

The honest position: we don't know yet. AI is either the hypothesis's strongest confirmation or a sector that will eventually reveal its limits. AI may ultimately prove more capital-intensive than current narratives suggest; the hypothesis survives only if downstream productivity gains continue to outpace broad capital formation. Time will tell which.

**What would restore DSGE validity?** An economy where growth again required broad tangible capital accumulation - massive green-energy infrastructure, capital-intensive reshoring, sustained physical investment that absorbs saving and restores capital scarcity. The critique here is structural, not ideological: DSGE would work if the world returned to capital-constrained growth.

**What would falsify this framework?**

- Intangible-intensive sectors prove as interest-sensitive as tangible-intensive sectors
- A sustained rise in real rates triggers a capex boom that absorbs saving and lifts r*
- Markups and rents fall materially (through competition), collapsing the asset return–safe rate wedge
- Credit and asset valuations fall but are replaced by broad-based tangible investment, not just deleveraging recession
- Australian long yields and term premia do *not* co-move with global QE shocks pre-2020

## Possible Extensions (Not Fully Theorised)

1. **Financial accelerator** (Bernanke-Gertler-Gilchrist): Asset prices affect borrowing constraints
2. **Collateral constraints** (Iacoviello): Housing values affect credit
3. **Wealth effects in IS curve**: Ad-hoc but captures the mechanism
4. **HANK models**: Heterogeneous agents with portfolio choice - frontier research

None of these fully resolves the disconnect. They're partial repairs to a framework that may be fundamentally incomplete for the post-GFC environment.

## Implications for Empirical Macro

1. **Semi-structural models may be more honest**: They don't pretend to microfoundations for transmission mechanisms that broke down. A NAIRU/output gap model estimated via state-space methods acknowledges what we can measure without imposing a theoretical structure that contradicts the data.

2. **Production function approach**: Deriving r* from MPK (Cobb-Douglas) gives the return on capital, which stayed elevated - different from LW/HLW's goods-market r*. This distinction matters.

3. **Reduced-form may outperform structural**: When the theory is wrong, flexible statistical models may fit better and forecast more reliably.

4. **Humility required**: The profession doesn't have a unified theory that explains 2008-2024.

## Summary

**The primitive failure**: Post-GFC macro theory failed not because markets malfunctioned, but because the object macro theory prices - reproducible capital scarcity - ceased to be the binding constraint on growth. Everything else follows from this.

The challenge isn't just estimation or computation. It's that:

> **We lack a unified, closed-form general-equilibrium framework that explains what happened.**

DSGE models assume away the features that would explain the post-GFC world: heterogeneous agents, multiple pricing kernels, asset-market segmentation from goods markets. Until theory catches up, structural estimation will struggle with parameters hitting bounds, implausible values, and poor out-of-sample performance.

The path forward likely requires either:
1. Fundamental theoretical innovation (new framework)
2. Honest semi-structural approaches that acknowledge what we don't know
3. Both

For applied work, this suggests semi-structural methods - like state-space NAIRU/output gap models with production function foundations - may be the appropriate tool. They don't claim to solve what theory hasn't solved.

**For central banks**: Monetary policy can still move asset prices and financial conditions, but it is poorly suited to restoring capital scarcity or re-anchoring r* to growth. The policy rate remains a tool; r* is no longer a reliable guide to its neutral setting.

**On policy effectiveness**: Post-GFC monetary and fiscal policy successfully stabilised levels of output and employment, but did not alter the underlying growth mechanism or restore the capital–investment–r* linkage. Demand stabilisation worked; the production structure did not change.
